## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Meaningful names** – Variables, functions, and classes should clearly describe their purpose.  
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Each function or class should do one thing and do it well.  
- **Incremental development** – Commit regularly, test small pieces of code often, and build up gradually.  
- **Consistent formatting** – Follow PEP 8 guidelines and use tools like “Reformat Code” to maintain readability.  
- **Separation of concerns** – Keep logic, data handling, and user interaction in separate parts of the program.
